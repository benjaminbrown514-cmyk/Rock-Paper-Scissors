View Results: An alert will display whether you won, lost, or tied the round.

🛠️ Technical Specifications
This project is built using vanilla JavaScript and relies on the following browser-native methods for the user interface:

prompt(): Used to capture the player's move (R, P, or S).

alert(): Used to display the outcome of the round and the running score.

confirm(): Used to ask the player if they wish to play another round.
